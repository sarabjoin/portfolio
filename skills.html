          I grew up in a family where computers and gaming are one of the main ways our family spends time together. 
          This has certainly helped guide me to be more interested in computers and gaming.
          With this comes quite a bit of basic computer knowledge including everything from basic use to doing
          restores and maintenance. 
      </p>
      <p>I have spent a lot of time utilizing PowerPoint, Excel, and Word as well as other programs such Visio,
        Visual Code, Visual Studio, Spyder, MySql, and  Azure (Networking and Machine Learning).
      </p>
      <p>
        My overall goal is to get into gaming design and development. I have also recently becam interested
        in databases as well. After all, all that information has to be saved somewhere right?
      </p>
      <p> 
        I have spent the majority of my life working in the food industry as a 
        restaurant general manager and have developed skills focused around customer satisfaction, team building,
        and securing profits. My most recient achievement is currently being the leading
        store (nation wide) in our company's newly launched Grab and Go program. I have achieved double the sales
        of the 2nd place store.
